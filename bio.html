									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>
										I graduated with my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the Cockrell School of
										Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016. My dual specializations
										were in Biomolecular and Cellular Engineering and Biomedical Instrumentation and Optics.
										I also completed an additional foundations certificate program through the McCombs
										School of Business. After about 5 years in industry, I decided to return to school,
										part-time and online, at the Georgia Institute of Technology (OMSCS). I'm currently
										pursuing a Masters in Computer Science and on-track to graduate May of 2023.
									</p>
									<p>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/bio02.JPG" alt="" /></span>
										During my undergraduate, I also participated in research labs within the Biomedical
										Engineering Department, including assistant positions in Dr. Laura Suggs Lab for
										Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering and Dr. Chong Xie's lab for nano-neural interfaces.
										During the summer periods, I held an internship at HMS Corp. as an ETL (Extract,
										Transfer, Load) intern, and two separate internships at Luminex Corp. as a Biomedical
										Engineering intern. My final year of college culminated in a Capstone Project associated
										with Asuragen.

									<h3>Career Brief</h3>
									<p>
										My first job out of college brought me out of Austin to Dallas, where I worked
										as a Project Engineer for St. Jude Medical (which during the course of my employment
										was acquired by <b><a href="https://www.abbott.com/">Abbott</a></b>). I worked with
										many great people and learned a great deal
										about Medical Devices and Neurostimulation in particular, but ultimately decided to move
										westward and back into the world of Biomedical Diagnostics as I had particularly enjoyed
										my internships with <b><a href="https://www.luminexcorp.com/">Luminex Corp.</a></b>
										and my Capstone Design experience with
										<b><a href="https://asuragen.com/">Asuragen</a></b>.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b><a href="https://www.tripleringtech.com/">Triple Ring Technologies</a></b>
										gave me my first introduction to Biotech in the bay,
										and I give them a lot of credit for providing really excellent mentorship and career
										development. As a BioEngineering Consultant I had the chance to work on a myriad of
										different projects, with a diverse and talented pool of engineers and clients. It was
										here that I started to spend much less of my time in the lab, and much more time,
										working cross-functionally to support the entire product. By the end of my time here,
										I was much more of a Systems Engineer than a BioEngineer. Triple Ring also gave me
										the opportunity to start applying my Software abilities to my industry work.
									</p>
									<p>
										I formally moved into Systems Engineering with the very smart and very
										hard-working folk at <b><a href="https://availsmedical.com/">Avails Medical</a></b> and later,
										<b><a href="https://www.sartorius.com/en">Sartorius</a></b>
										(formerly ForteBio). In this capacity I was exposed to a broader spectrum of Verification,
										Validation, and Product Development strategies (Requirements, Design Practices,
										etc.). I also had more freedom to bridge gaps and develop innovative solutions for
										some really important technical hurdles. I realized that I was quite a competent
										programmer and really adept at bridging communication gaps between the Hardware and
										Software teams that I worked with. This prompted me to enroll in Graduate School
										part time and online at Georgia Tech to get stronger fundamentals in Computer Science.
									</p>
									<p>
										Ultimately, I was able to leverage my background and my education into a Software Development
										Engineering position with
										<b><a href="https://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#welcome>">Amazon Alexa's Health and Wellness team.</a></b>
										Here, I was able to learn
										formal Software Engineering from some of the best and brightest in the field. We practiced
										development for various Health and Wellness apps, some of which would service thousands of
										requests per second. Unfortunately, in Amazon's restructuring of the Devices team,
										the Health and Wellness team was retired and I am now searching for my next opportunity!
